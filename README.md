This repository contains a collection of the projects I built during my internship at Tenstorrent in Summer 2024. They include:
- A graph visualizer for ML operations in TT-NN.
- A performance analyzer for ML operations in TT-NN.
- A graphing tool for L1 buffer utilization during ML processes on Tenstorrent Grayskull and Wormhole cards.
- A web-based Stable Diffusion playground running on Tenstorrent Wormhole devices.
- An evaluation system for Stable Diffusion models in TT-NN.
